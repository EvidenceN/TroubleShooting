Problem: ImportError: DLL load failed while importing shell: Can not find procedure.

Solution: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/11503

What I tried:  Run this `pip install --upgrade pywin32==228`  in powershell. 
Gave error about permissions. Ran it again in powershell as admin, then was succesfull and 
proceeded with other anaconda activities like installing anaconda navigator.
